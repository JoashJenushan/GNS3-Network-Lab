# GNS3-Network-Lab
The GNS3-Network-Lab is meant to provide a complete educational experience in Cisco networking. This lab utilizes GNS3, an effective network simulation environment, to give real-world guidance on important topics such as inter-VLAN routing, Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP), Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). 

This lab allows individuals to get an understanding of advanced networking principles and configurations. All content is clearly explained, with practical examples and real-world situations to help students understand.

Additionally, all of the topics presented in the lab are thoroughly described on my YouTube channel. Learners may follow along, practice in a virtual setting, and reinforce their understanding with practical examples.

Join the GNS3-Network-Lab to improve your skills in networking and be ready for real-world challenges with networking.
