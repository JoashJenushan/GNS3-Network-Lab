> [!IMPORTANT]
> An engineer monitored the PortChannel between <code>**Switch03 to Switch01**</code>, which is configured as PortChannel 3. The PortChannel consists of two interfaces.
> When the engineer pings a **Server from miniOS-02**, they observe the following behavior in Wireshark:
>
>     On one interface, they capture ICMP ping requests to the server.
> 
>     On the other interface, they capture ICMP ping replies from the server.
